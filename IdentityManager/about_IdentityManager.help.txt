SHORT DESCRIPTION
    IdentityManager is a PowerShell interface for the One Identity REST API Web Services.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    IdentityManager sends requests to , and receives data from, a One Identity REST API Web Service.
    It issues commands to the Web Service allowing a user to issue create, list, modify and delete operations to be
    performed against entities in a One Identity Manager solution from either a PowerShell console or script.

EXAMPLES
    To use IdentityManager, access to a  One Identity REST API  Web Service, as well as a user account with which to
    authenticate to the Web Service is required.


    Authentication to the Web Service must take place before any other commands can be issued, every
    subsequent call to the web service requires the resulting authorization token returned upon successful logon.

    LOGON:

    PS C:\> New-OIMSession -Credential $VaultCredentials -BaseURI https://PVWA_URL

    Successful authentication with New-OIMSession results in the required authorization token value being made available to all subsequent calls to the API

    PIPELINE OPERATIONS:

    All functions of the module accept pipeline input, allowing chains of commands to be created.

        Find and update a user:

        PS C:\> Get-OIMObject pete | Set-OIMObject -Properties @{FirstName = "John"} 

        Activate a Suspended CyberArk User:

        PS C:\> Get-OIMObject -Object Person -Where "Firstname = 'PebKac'" | Unblock-OIMUser -Suspended $false
